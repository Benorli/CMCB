The each file contains a different approach to the same model. The relevant file is 'random_walk'. This file is used for
the notebooks. It was chosen based on readability, speed, and function (handling no decision being made).

The method variety is premature optimization. I have kept the files, as the exploration of methods was educational and
they document what I learnt. My motivation for the exploration being the common occurrence trial based tasks in
experiments and modeling.
