# Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behavior
Working through the book: Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behavior

This repository contains notes and scripts following the book: Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behavior. 
The book includes snippets in R code, which I will attempt to recreate in Python here. Notes regarding the ideas 
and concepts of the book are included as Jupyter notebooks.

Concepts and ideas are taken from the book which can be found here:
